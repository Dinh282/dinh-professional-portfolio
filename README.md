# <Dinh's-Portfolio>

## Description

This project involves the creation of my professional portfolio webpage that showcases my skills, experience, and future 
projects to potential employers and clients. The project helped me understand the relationship between HTML and CSS. Using HTML
I was able to create the structure of my page, and by linking it to CSS I was able to add style to the page and make it presentable. 
The page contains navigation links that takes the user to different section of the main page, as well as links that takes the user to 
different webpages of my future projects. For now, when the user clicks on the different images in the work section, it will just take them 
to a place holder page (https://google.com).
